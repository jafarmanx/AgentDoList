# CurioArch — AgentDoList

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents working with this repository.

## What is CurioArch?

CurioArch — AgentDoList is a Kanban-style project management tool where AI agent personas do the work. Cards (tasks/issues) are organized across boards and columns, and can be assigned to digital Agent personas that have skills, tools, and personalities. Each agent gets a workspace to do their work, and the output is displayed back on the card.

### Core Agent System

**Agent** — A digital persona with a name, role, personality, skills, and system prompt. Agents belong to an Account and can be assigned to cards.

**AgentSkill** — Skills an agent has (e.g., "Ruby on Rails", "Testing", "UI Design") with proficiency levels.

**AgentAssignment** — Links an agent to a card with status tracking (pending/working/completed/failed).

**Agent::Workspace** — Created automatically when an agent is assigned. Contains the agent's output (rich text), deliverables (file attachments), and a work log.

## Development Commands

### Setup and Server
```bash
bin/setup              # Initial setup (installs gems, creates DB, loads schema)
bin/dev                # Start development server (runs on port 3006)
```

Development URL: http://curioarch.localhost:3006
Login with: david@example.com (development fixtures), password will appear in the browser console

### Testing
```bash
bin/rails test                    # Run unit tests (fast)
bin/rails test test/path/file_test.rb  # Run single test file
bin/rails test:system             # Run system tests (Capybara + Selenium)
bin/ci                            # Run full CI suite (style, security, tests)

# For parallel test execution issues, use:
PARALLEL_WORKERS=1 bin/rails test
```

CI pipeline (`bin/ci`) runs:
1. Rubocop (style)
2. Bundler audit (gem security)
3. Importmap audit
4. Brakeman (security scan)
5. Application tests
6. System tests

### Database
```bash
bin/rails db:fixtures:load   # Load fixture data
bin/rails db:migrate          # Run migrations
bin/rails db:reset            # Drop, create, and load schema
```

### Other Utilities
```bash
bin/rails dev:email          # Toggle letter_opener for email preview
bin/jobs                     # Manage Solid Queue jobs
bin/kamal deploy             # Deploy (requires 1Password CLI for secrets)
```

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Tenancy (URL-Based)

CurioArch uses **URL path-based multi-tenancy**:
- Each Account (tenant) has a unique `external_account_id` (7+ digits)
- URLs are prefixed: `/{account_id}/boards/...`
- Middleware (`AccountSlug::Extractor`) extracts the account ID from the URL and sets `Current.account`
- The slug is moved from `PATH_INFO` to `SCRIPT_NAME`, making Rails think it's "mounted" at that path
- All models include `account_id` for data isolation
- Background jobs automatically serialize and restore account context

**Key insight**: This architecture allows multi-tenancy without subdomains or separate databases, making local development and testing simpler.

### Authentication & Authorization

**Passwordless magic link authentication**:
- Global `Identity` (email-based) can have `Users` in multiple Accounts
- Users belong to an Account and have roles: owner, admin, member, system
- Sessions managed via signed cookies
- Board-level access control via `Access` records

### Core Domain Models

**Account** → The tenant/organization
- Has users, boards, cards, tags, webhooks
- Has entropy configuration for auto-postponement

**Identity** → Global user (email)
- Can have Users in multiple Accounts
- Session management tied to Identity

**User** → Account membership
- Belongs to Account and Identity
- Has role (owner/admin/member/system)
- Board access via explicit `Access` records

**Board** → Primary organizational unit
- Has columns for workflow stages
- Can be "all access" or selective
- Can be published publicly with shareable key

**Card** → Main work item (task/issue)
- Sequential number within each Account
- Rich text description and attachments
- Lifecycle: triage → columns → closed/not_now
- Automatically postpones after inactivity ("entropy")

**Event** → Records all significant actions
- Polymorphic association to changed object
- Drives activity timeline, notifications, webhooks
- Has JSON `particulars` for action-specific data

### Entropy System

Cards automatically "postpone" (move to "not now") after inactivity:
- Account-level default entropy period
- Board-level entropy override
- Prevents endless todo lists from accumulating
- Configurable via Account/Board settings

### UUID Primary Keys

All tables use UUIDs (UUIDv7 format, base36-encoded as 25-char strings):
- Custom fixture UUID generation maintains deterministic ordering for tests
- Fixtures are always "older" than runtime records
- `.first`/`.last` work correctly in tests

### Background Jobs (Solid Queue)

Database-backed job queue (no Redis):
- Custom `CurioArchActiveJobExtensions` prepended to ActiveJob
- Jobs automatically capture/restore `Current.account`
- Mission Control::Jobs for monitoring

Key recurring tasks (via `config/recurring.yml`):
- Deliver bundled notifications (every 30 min)
- Auto-postpone stale cards (hourly)
- Cleanup jobs for expired links, deliveries

### Sharded Full-Text Search

16-shard MySQL full-text search instead of Elasticsearch:
- Shards determined by account ID hash (CRC32)
- Search records denormalized for performance
- Models in `app/models/search/`

## Tools

### Chrome MCP (Local Dev)

URL: `http://curioarch.localhost:3006`
Login: david@example.com (passwordless magic link auth - check rails console for link)

Use Chrome MCP tools to interact with the running dev app for UI testing and debugging.
